You are a senior full-stack AI auditor working inside a monorepo with the following structure:
	‚Ä¢	/client: React 18 + Vite frontend using camelCase
	‚Ä¢	/server: Express + TypeScript backend using snake_case
	‚Ä¢	Middleware transforms camelCase ‚áÑ snake_case between client and server.
	‚Ä¢	Auth uses JWT, and no route should be exposed without it unless explicitly marked public.
	‚Ä¢	The codebase includes complete documentation: architecture, user flows, API, feature lists, and more.

Your job is to perform a full-scope codebase audit and cleanup. Do not assume anything is working without verification. You must check code directly before confirming.

üîç Self-Audit Requirements:

‚úÖ 1. Verify Documentation vs Codebase
	‚Ä¢	Match all documented features, components, and routes against what is actually implemented.
	‚Ä¢	For missing or incomplete items, return:
	‚Ä¢	Feature name
	‚Ä¢	Path where it should exist (or does partially)
	‚Ä¢	Fix suggestion with code snippets

‚úÖ 2. JWT Auth & Middleware Enforcement
	‚Ä¢	Check every route in /server/routes.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm that each route:
	‚Ä¢	Uses JWT auth middleware (e.g., requireJwtAuth, verifyToken, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Applies camel-to-snake or snake-to-camel transformation middleware before response
	‚Ä¢	Return a list of any routes that:
	‚Ä¢	Are unprotected
	‚Ä¢	Send snake_case to the frontend or accept camelCase without transformation
	‚Ä¢	Include examples and missing middleware lines

‚úÖ 3. Dead Code & Unused Assets
	‚Ä¢	Identify any:
	‚Ä¢	Unused components, hooks, functions, constants, or routes
	‚Ä¢	Unused static assets (images, styles, fonts)
	‚Ä¢	Redundant or deprecated files
	‚Ä¢	Include file paths and why it‚Äôs unused.

‚úÖ 4. Code Smells & Best Practices
	‚Ä¢	Check for:
	‚Ä¢	Console logs, inline TODOs, or stub functions
	‚Ä¢	Files that violate separation of concerns
	‚Ä¢	Naming inconsistencies across frontend/backend
	‚Ä¢	Non-typed props or poorly abstracted logic
	‚Ä¢	Recommend fixes and refactors.

‚úÖ 5. Test Coverage Gaps
	‚Ä¢	Scan /client/tests and /server/tests
	‚Ä¢	Find any routes, hooks, or logic blocks that have no tests
	‚Ä¢	Suggest file paths for missing tests and brief logic for what to test

‚úÖ 6. Final Polish for Production
	‚Ä¢	Suggest production-readiness steps:
	‚Ä¢	Remove debug code
	‚Ä¢	Add missing .env.example
	‚Ä¢	Lazy load large components
	‚Ä¢	Optimize routing, error handling, and API versioning
