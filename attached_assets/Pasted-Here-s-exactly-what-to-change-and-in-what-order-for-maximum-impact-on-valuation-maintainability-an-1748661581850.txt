Here‚Äôs exactly what to change and in what order for maximum impact on valuation, maintainability, and buyer readiness:

üî• Priority 1 ‚Äî High Impact, High Visibility
‚úÖ 1. Demo Analytics Data
What to change:
Move from hardcoded analytics to a .json config or DB seed that can vary by orgId.

Why:
Investors & demo clients want realistic sandbox data. Also critical for future trials or sales demos.

How:

ts
Copy
Edit
const getDemoAnalytics = (orgId) => {
  return fetchFromDB(`demo_analytics_${orgId}`) || defaultAnalytics;
};
‚úÖ 2. App Name ("NestMap") & Branding
What to change:
Make app name, logos, color scheme dynamic per organization via DB or env.

Why:
This instantly increases value by enabling white-label resale and prevents rework for enterprise clients.

How:
Replace all NestMap strings in meta tags, mobile configs, header, and doc titles with branding.appName

‚úÖ 3. Booking Provider URLs
What to change:
Use dynamic templates or overrideable configs for travel URLs (booking.com, etc.).

Why:
White-label clients might have affiliate agreements or prefer their own providers.

How:

ts
Copy
Edit
bookingUrl: config.bookingProviders[orgId]?.urlTemplate || defaultTemplate;
‚öôÔ∏è Priority 2 ‚Äî DevOps and Deployment Readiness
‚úÖ 4. Hardcoded Port Numbers / Localhost
What to change:
Move port (5000) and localhost OAuth redirect URLs to .env or dynamic resolution.

Why:
These break on staging/production builds and during mobile OAuth flows.

How:
Use:

bash
Copy
Edit
PORT=process.env.PORT || 5000
REDIRECT_URI=process.env.OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI
‚úÖ 5. Color Values in loadBalancer.ts
What to change:
Replace hardcoded fallback hex codes with either:

An env-configured theme

Or global theme values per organization

Why:
Allows real-time customization and ensures consistent styling.

How:
Query org‚Äôs theme from DB; fallback to brand-wide default.

üßº Priority 3 ‚Äî Professional Polish
‚úÖ 6. Placeholder URLs (help links, example.com)
What to change:
Add real fallback URLs to onboarding, support, and privacy pages ‚Äî or use orgSettings.helpURL

Why:
‚Äúexample.com‚Äù is a red flag in buyer audits and live demos.

How:
Replace:

ts
Copy
Edit
placeholder="https://example.com/privacy"
with:

ts
Copy
Edit
placeholder={orgSettings.privacyURL || defaultPrivacyURL}
‚úÖ 7. Default Email Domains
What to change:
Replace test@, demo@, and example.com with either:

Dynamic templates like {user}@{org.domain}

Or explicit form validation for proper structure

Why:
Adds credibility to demo flows and avoids QA confusion.

üîÅ Bonus ‚Äî Dynamic Demo Profiles
If you're doing B2B sales:
Offer dynamic profiles like:

agency_demo@nestmap.com

enterprise_demo@nestmap.com

Each with different:

Permissions

Trip data

Proposal examples

This closes deals faster during live walkthroughs.
