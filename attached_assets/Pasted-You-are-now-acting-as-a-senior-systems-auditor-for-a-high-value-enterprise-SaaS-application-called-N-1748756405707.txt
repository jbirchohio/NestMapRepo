You are now acting as a senior systems auditor for a high-value enterprise SaaS application called NestMap. I need a full internal intelligence report to prove the app’s technical value and feature depth for acquisition purposes.

⚙️ Task:
Scan the **entire codebase** and produce a comprehensive system architecture + feature report that includes:

1. 📦 Tech Stack Breakdown
   - Frontend frameworks, component libraries, state management
   - Backend runtime, database ORM, API layer, session handling
   - DevOps: CI/CD tools, deployment environments, build systems
   - Mobile: Capacitor, native builds, PWA configs

2. 🔐 Auth & Security Architecture
   - Authentication (Supabase? Passport?)
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Tenant isolation (how it’s enforced in middleware + DB queries)
   - Rate limiting, CSRF, session protection

3. 🧩 Core Business Features
   - AI trip planner: what files are involved, how OpenAI is called
   - Map integration: how Mapbox is used (UI + routing)
   - Booking system: how Amadeus API works
   - Analytics: what’s collected, where calculated, how scoped per org
   - PDF exports: what tech (Puppeteer?) generates them
   - Proposal + budgeting: where tracked, how editable, what roles allowed
   - Mobile/PWA: responsiveness + deployment readiness

4. 🏢 White Labeling & Multi-Tenant Support
   - How orgs are created, isolated, and switched (custom domains?)
   - Which components change per org (branding, theme, access scope)
   - Where orgs are scoped in database & middleware

5. 💾 Data Models & Relationships
   - Overview of key tables (users, trips, activities, bookings)
   - Show schema links between user/org/trip/booking
   - Highlight any foreign key structure enforcing tenant safety

6. 🧠 Intelligent Inference
   - Identify features that “look” like enterprise-grade even if not labeled
   - Point out any “clever” architecture decisions that add value
   - Identify anything that *pretends* to work but is fake (e.g., success toasts)

7. 🧪 Testing & Verification
   - Which routes are protected?
   - Are auth/role/org checks actually enforced?
   - Which critical systems (trip creation, booking, analytics) are tested?

🎯 Output Format:
Make this a clearly organized markdown-style **internal product intelligence doc** with 7 sections matching the points above.

This will be used to justify a 7-figure valuation for an AI-powered enterprise SaaS travel platform. Be honest and detailed. Skip filler. Focus on proving real-world implementation and acquisition-readiness.
