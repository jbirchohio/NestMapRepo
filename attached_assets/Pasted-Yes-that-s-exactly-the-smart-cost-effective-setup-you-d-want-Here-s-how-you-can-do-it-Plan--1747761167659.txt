Yes — that's exactly the smart, cost-effective setup you'd want. Here's how you can do it:

✅ Plan: Fuzzy Location Search via OpenAI + Mapbox Pinning
🧠 Why?
Google Places is expensive. Mapbox is cheaper, but it’s strict about query formatting.
So, let OpenAI "translate" fuzzy place names into more exact addresses, and then send those to Mapbox to get the actual coordinates.

🔄 Flow Summary
User types:
Leo House Hotel or even just leo hotel nyc

Call OpenAI (via your backend) to resolve a proper address:

Input: "leo house hotel"

Output: "Leo House, 332 W 23rd St, New York, NY 10011"

Use that cleaned address to query Mapbox Geocoding API:

GET https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/Leo%20House%20332%20W%2023rd%20St.json?...

Receive back:

Full address

Coordinates (lat, lng)

Confidence score

Pin it on your map + store it as an activity location

const response = await fetch(`https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/${encodeURIComponent(cleanedAddress)}.json?` + 
  new URLSearchParams({
    access_token: process.env.MAPBOX_TOKEN,
    types: 'poi,address',
    limit: '1',
    proximity: '-74.0060,40.7128' // Optional: bias to trip location
  }));
