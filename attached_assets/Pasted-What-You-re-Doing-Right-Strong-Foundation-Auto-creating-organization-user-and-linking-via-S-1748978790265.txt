What You’re Doing Right

🧱 Strong Foundation
	•	Auto-creating organization, user, and linking via Supabase at signup = solid multi-tenant model.
	•	Granular role-based access control ensures data safety and separation.
	•	White-label setup and domain mapping is enterprise gold.

🔐 Security-First
	•	JWT auth + org-scoped APIs + scoped queries = secure and scalable.
	•	Expiring invite tokens and role inheritance flow are industry-standard.

📊 Post-Onboarding Utility
	•	Analytics, budgeting, and receipt handling encourage long-term retention and visibility.
	•	Stripe Issuing and automated expense rules provide real business value.

⚡ Opportunities to Tighten the Funnel

1. Add a “Quick Start” Wizard Post Signup

Instead of dumping the user into a blank dashboard, include a setup wizard with:
	•	✅ Company info
	•	✅ Invite team
	•	✅ Add first trip
	•	✅ Configure billing (or skip for now)

This guides them through the “aha moment” in under 5 mins.

2. Progress Tracking UI

Show visual onboarding progress (like a checklist):
	•	Company profile
	•	Team invites
	•	First trip created
	•	Billing configured

This gamifies the experience and nudges completion.

⸻

3. First Trip Pre-Fill Option

When a user registers, auto-create a sample trip:
	•	Title: “Sample Business Trip to NYC”
	•	Dates: Next week
	•	Budget: $2,500
	•	Message: “You can customize or delete this later.”

It gets them into the “see it in action” phase faster.

⸻

4. Slack/Email Integration Prompt Early

Right after team invite, show:

“Want to get alerts for approvals, travel changes, or expense overages? Connect Slack or set up email notifications.”

That enhances long-term stickiness and embeds NestMap into daily workflows.

⸻

5. Inline Tooltips + Walkthroughs

Use something like Shepherd.js or Intro.js to provide:
	•	Tooltips when hovering over key actions
	•	Guided tour after login
	•	Microcopy in empty states like:
“No trips yet — why not plan your first one?”

🧪 Future Feature Suggestions
	•	SCIM or SAML Integration: For enterprise IT departments (Okta, Azure AD)
	•	Audit Trails: Visual timeline for actions like trip edits, approvals, etc.
	•	Single Sign-On Branding: So users land on travel.acme.com and log in directly to their branded space.
