✅ Final Checklist to Deliver a Clean NestMap Project via Replit
📁 1. Project Structure + Clarity
 Keep /client and /server folders clearly defined (if applicable)

 Include README.md and SETUP_GUIDE.md at root

 Add a /docs folder with screenshots, API.md, and license (if not already included)

 Ensure schema.sql is located in /schema/ and referenced correctly

🔐 2. Environment & Secrets
 .env.example included

 Ensure no .env is committed to Git

 All required environment keys are listed:

DATABASE_URL

OPENAI_API_KEY

MAPBOX_TOKEN

VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN

VITE_SUPABASE_URL

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

🧠 3. AI Integration (GPT-4o)
 All assistant tools are accessible via UI

 Assistant has error handling (e.g., "try again" state)

 Model and temperature are configurable via .env

 Use function_calling or tools with OpenAI for structure parsing

🧭 4. Map Integration
 Mapbox token scoped and secured via MAPBOX_TOKEN (server) and VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN (client)

 Map centers properly on trip region

 Route and pin logic cleanly handles 1–20 stops

 Fallbacks for location resolution failures

📦 5. Supabase & Database
 Supabase Auth works (login, session persist, logout)

 Trips persist correctly across reload

 Database schema (users, trips, activities, etc.) is normalized and exported

 Include SQL dump or schema migration file (schema.sql already referenced)

📱 6. UI Polish & Mobile Responsiveness
 Mobile map full-screen toggle implemented

 Add-Activity and Assistant buttons are visible on all viewports

 Tab switching (Itinerary / Notes / Tasks) works smoothly

 Fonts, paddings, z-index, and touch targets are optimized for mobile

🚀 7. Deployment Readiness
 Replit supports .replit or replit.nix

 Replit secrets are referenced in production mode

 Add npm run build and start scripts

 Optional: add vercel.json or Render config for off-Replit hosting

📦 8. Transfer-Ready Artifacts
 README.md includes tech stack, setup, and features

 SETUP_GUIDE.md includes full instructions

 Include LICENSE file (MIT recommended)

 Add a changelog or roadmap if continuing development

 Include 3–5 clean demo screenshots in /docs/screenshots/

📋 9. (Optional) Extras for Sellability
 Add demo.mp4 or demo.gif to showcase assistant and map

 Include SALES_NOTES.md for buyers (pricing ideas, roadmap, scaling)
