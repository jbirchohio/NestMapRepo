Handle verification with the API
Learn how Connect platforms can use webhooks and the API to handle verification of connected accounts.
Copy page
Account properties
Connected accounts can be configured with properties that determine how the account will behave. Account types can be mapped to their corresponding properties.
This content applies to connected accounts when you're responsible for collecting updated information when requirements are due or change. This includes Custom accounts.
Connect platforms that onboard connected accounts using the API must provide Stripe with required information for Know Your Customer (KYC) purposes and to enable account capabilities. They must collect the information themselves and use the Accounts and Persons APIs to provide it to Stripe. We then verify the information, asking for more details when needed.

Stripe risk reviews
Stripe risk reviews of an account can add extra requirements, which you can’t fulfill using the API. Instead, enable your connected accounts to respond using embedded components, Stripe-hosted onboarding, or remediation links. You can also use your platform Dashboard to respond to risk reviews on behalf of your connected accounts.

Verification process
Before enabling charges and payouts for a connected account, Stripe needs certain information that varies based on:

The origin country of the connected accounts
The service agreement type applicable to the connected accounts
The capabilities requested for the connected accounts
The business_type (for example, individual or company) and company.structure (for example, public_corporation or private_partnership)
Platforms need to choose the proper onboarding flow for their business and users to meet the KYC requirements. Broadly speaking, this means providing all the requisite information upfront or incrementally. Either way, set up your integration to watch for and respond to requests from Stripe.

Establish a Connect webhook URL in your webhook settings to watch for activity, especially events of the account.updated type. When using the Persons API, you should also watch for person.updated events.
Immediately after creating an account, check the Account object’s requirements.currently_due attribute for any additional requirements. Obtain any required information from the user and update the connected account.
Continue watching for account.updated event notifications to see if the requirements hash changes, and reach out to your user for additional information as needed.
When you provide additional information, you don’t need to resubmit any previously verified details. For example, if the dob is already verified, you don’t need to provide it again in subsequent updates.

Caution
When requirements.currently_due isn’t empty, additional information is required. Connected accounts might be blocked from creating charges, receiving payouts, or performing certain tasks if you don’t provide this information in a timely manner.

Change information after verification
After an individual or company is verified, you can change some of their information, with limitations. See the Update Account API for limitations based on the configuration of the connected account. Contact support to make changes outside of these limitations.

Determine if verification is needed
When you receive an account.updated event to your webhook or fetch an account with the API, you receive an Account object. The Account object’s charges_enabled and payouts_enabled attributes indicate whether the account can create charges and accept payouts.

The Account object has a requirements hash, representing the requirements needed to verify the account.

The requirements hash has the following arrays:

eventually_due: Requirements that you might need to collect, depending on whether the corresponding thresholds are reached. After a requirement becomes required, it also appears in the currently_due list. If a requirement becomes required and its due date is before the existing current_deadline, the current_deadline changes to the corresponding threshold’s enforcement date.
currently_due: Requirements that you must collect by the current_deadline for the Account to remain active. currently_due is a subset of eventually_due.
past_due: Requirements that have disabled capabilities because they weren’t verified before the current_deadline. past_due is a subset of currently_due.
errors: Details about validation and verification failures that require particular requirements in currently_due or past_due to be collected again.
requirement: Identifies the requirement corresponding to the error.
code: An enum value describing why the requirement is invalid or can’t be verified.
reason: An English message describing the error in more detail. The reason string can also suggest how to resolve the error.
disabled_reason: Describes why the Account isn’t enabled and why it can’t process charges or transfers.
current_deadline: Date by which requirements in currently_due must be collected to keep the Account active. It represents the earliest deadline across all of the Account’s requested capabilities and risk requirements, including any hidden capabilities.
pending_verification: Requirements that might become required, depending on the results of verification or review. It’s an empty array unless an asynchronous verification is pending. Unsuccessful verification moves a requirement to eventually_due, currently_due, or past_due. A requirement subject to both failed and pending verifications can also remain in pending_verification.
The example below shows what the requirements hash might look like for an account that has some information that’s currently_due, some information that’s eventually_due, and some information that’s raising verification errors.




{
  "id": "{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
  "object": "account",
  "requirements": {
      "disabled_reason": null,
      "current_deadline": 1529085600,
      "past_due": [],
      "currently_due": [
          "company.tax_id",
          "company.verification.document",
          "tos_acceptance.date",
          "tos_acceptance.ip"
      ],
      "eventually_due": [
          "company.address.city",
          "company.address.line1",
          "company.address.postal_code",
          "company.address.state",
          "company.tax_id",
          "company.verification.document",
          "external_account",
          "tos_acceptance.date",
          "tos_acceptance.ip"
      ],
      "errors": [
          {
            "requirement": "company.verification.document",
            "reason": "The company name on the account couldn't be verified. Either update your business name or upload a document containing the business name.",
            "code": "failed_name_match"
          },
      ]
  },
  ...
}
If requirements.currently_due contains entries, check requirements.current_deadline. The current_deadline is a Unix timestamp identifying when information is needed. Usually, if Stripe doesn’t receive the information by the current_deadline, payouts on the account are disabled. However, other consequences might apply in some situations. For example, if payouts are already disabled and the account is unresponsive to our inquiries, Stripe might also disable the ability to process charges.

Separately, the requirements.disabled_reason property can have a value. The value is a string describing the reason why this account is unable to make payouts or charges. In some instances, platforms and connected accounts can submit a form to resolve or appeal the reason.

Connected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard, including Standard accounts, can access additional information (if available) in the Dashboard.
Platforms can look up an account on the Connected accounts page to determine an account’s disabled_reason. You might be able to provide additional information on behalf of your connected accounts. If the disabled reason is associated with an appeal, you can generate a link to a form for the account to resolve the appeal.
Reason	Meaning
action_required.requested_capabilities	You need to request capabilities for the connected account. For details, see Request and unrequest capabilities.
listed	Account might be on a prohibited persons or companies list (Stripe investigates and either rejects or reinstates the account accordingly).
rejected.fraud	Account is rejected due to suspected fraud or illegal activity.
rejected.incomplete_verification	The account is rejected from incomplete verification requirements within the required threshold.
rejected.listed	Account is rejected because it’s on a third-party prohibited persons or companies list (such as financial services provider or government).
rejected.other	Account is rejected for another reason.
rejected.terms_of_service	Account is rejected due to suspected terms of service violations.
requirements.past_due	Additional verification information is required to enable capabilities on this account.
requirements.pending_verification	Stripe is currently verifying information on the connected account. No action is required. Inspect the requirements.pending_verification array to see the information being verified.
under_review	The account is under review by Stripe.
Validation and verification errors
The Account object includes a requirements.errors array that explains why the validation or verification requirements haven’t been met, which are needed to enable your account and capabilities. The errors array has the following attributes:

requirement: Specifies which information from the currently_due array is needed.
code: Indicates the type of error that occurred. See the API reference for all possible error codes.
reason: Explains why the error occurred and how to resolve the error.
Below is an example that shows what the errors array might look like for an account with requirements that are currently_due. The example shows the reason why the submitted information can’t be used to enable the account, and how to resolve the error. If verification or validation is unsuccessful, requirements can reappear in currently_due with error information. Set a Connect webhook to receive the account.updated event to receive these updates.




{
  "id": "{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
  "object": "account",
  "requirements": {
      "current_deadline": 1234567800,
      "currently_due": [
          "company.address.line1",
          "{{PERSON_ID}}.verification.document",
      ],
      "errors": [
          {
            "requirement": "company.address.line1",
            "code": "invalid_street_address",
            "reason": "The provided street address cannot be found. Please verify the street name and number are correct in \"10 Downing Street\"",
          },
          {
            "requirement": "{{PERSON_ID}}.verification.document",
            "code": "verification_document_failed_greyscale",
            "reason": "Greyscale documents cannot be read. Please upload a color copy of the document.",
          }
      ]
  },
  ...
}
If verification or validation is unsuccessful but no requirements are currently due, a webhook triggers indicating that required information is eventually due.

Business information
When information about a business is submitted, Stripe verifies the new information. For example, Stripe might verify that the provided business URL is valid, reachable, and includes information about the business. To check the status of verification information regarding a business, retrieve the Account’s requirements hash.

Below is a list of errors related to business information verification:

Error	Resolution
invalid_business_profile_name	Business names must be easy for people to understand and must consist of recognizable words.
invalid_business_profile_name_denylisted	Generic or well-known business names aren’t supported. Make sure the provided business name matches the account’s business.
invalid_product_description_length	A product description must be at least 10 characters.
invalid_product_description_url_match	A product description must be different from the URL of the business.
invalid_url_denylisted

invalid_url_format

invalid_url_web_presence_detected

invalid_url_website_business_information_mismatch

invalid_url_website_empty

invalid_url_website_inaccessible

invalid_url_website_inaccessible_geoblocked

invalid_url_website_inaccessible_password_protected

invalid_url_website_incomplete

invalid_url_website_incomplete_cancellation_policy

invalid_url_website_incomplete_customer_service_details

invalid_url_website_incomplete_return_policy

invalid_url_website_incomplete_terms_and_conditions

invalid_url_website_incomplete_under_construction

invalid_url_website_other

See Handle URL verification errors below.

Statement descriptors
Stripe validates the statement descriptor and statement descriptor prefix when set on an account. For example, Stripe might verify that the provided statement descriptor matches the description of the business. When validating the statement descriptor matches the business description, Stripe uses the first 22 characters of the statement descriptor, representing the part that is provided to the card networks. A business description is a close match of the account’s business_profile.name, business_profile.url, or the name of the company or individual.

To retrieve the status of verification information regarding statement descriptors, review the requirements on the Account object. Below is a list of errors related to statement descriptor verification:

Error	Resolution
invalid_statement_descriptor_length	A statement descriptor must be at least 5 characters.
invalid_statement_descriptor_business_mismatch	A statement descriptor must be similar to the business name, legal entity name, or URL of the account.
invalid_statement_descriptor_denylisted

invalid_statement_descriptor_prefix_denylisted

Generic or well-known statement descriptors aren’t supported.

invalid_statement_descriptor_prefix_mismatch	The statement descriptor prefix must be similar to your statement descriptor, business name, legal entity name, or URL.
Business representatives
You must collect and submit information about the people associated with a connected account. The process depends on whether your connected accounts are companies or individuals:

Companies only: Use the Persons API to add the information to a Person associated with the Account.
Individuals only: You can use the Persons API or the individual hash on the Account object.
A combination of individuals and companies: Use the Persons API to add the information to a Person associated with the account. That lets you use the same process for all of your connected accounts, regardless of their type.
To retrieve the status of verification information regarding a person, use the requirements hash.

Below is a list of errors related to person verification:

Error	Resolution
invalid_address_city_state_postal_code	Stripe couldn’t validate the combination of the city, state, and postal code in the provided address.
invalid_address_highway_contract_box	The address of the person must be a valid physical address from which the account conducts business and can’t be a Highway Contract Box.
invalid_address_private_mailbox	The address of the person must be a valid physical address from which the account conducts business and can’t be a private mailbox.
invalid_dob_age_under_minimum	The person must be at least 13 years old.
invalid_dob_age_over_maximum	The person’s date of birth must be within the past 120 years.
invalid_phone_number	Stripe couldn’t validate the phone number on the account. Make sure the formatting matches the country of the person.
invalid_street_address	Stripe couldn’t validate the street name and/or number for the provided address.
invalid_tax_id

invalid_tax_id_format

Tax IDs must be a unique set of 9 numbers without dashes or other special characters.

Acceptable verification documents by country
To learn about specific document requirements, view Acceptable verification documents by country.

Company information
During the verification process, you might need to collect information about the company for an account.

To retrieve the status of verification information regarding an account’s company, use the Account’s company.verification subhash:




{
  "id": "{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
  "object": "account",
  ...
  "company": {
    "verification": {
      "document": null
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
You can look up the definition for each verification attribute on the Account object.

Handle document verification problems
Problems with identity documents, either with uploaded files themselves or with using them to validate other information, cause many requirement verification errors. To help you recognize and handle the most common problems, the tables below list requirement error code values related to document issues and provide guidance for resolving them.

verification_rejected_ownership_exemption_reason	The ownership exemption reason was rejected. Choose a different exemption reason or upload a proof of ultimate beneficial ownership document instead.
Caution
Don’t resubmit a file that previously failed. Duplicate uploads immediately trigger an error and aren’t rechecked.

Handle URL verification errors
URLs for e-commerce businesses need to conform to certain card network standards. In order to comply with these standards, Stripe conducts a number of verifications when reviewing URLs. To learn about best practices for URLs and common elements for e-commerce businesses, see the website checklist.

In many cases, you can resolve business URL verification errors by generating a remediation link from your platform Dashboard. Otherwise, update the Account’s business_profile.url. If you resolve the error another way, such as by fixing a problem with the company’s website, trigger re-verification by changing the URL on the Account to any other value, then immediately changing it back.

Not all URL-related issues can be resolved using the API. Certain types of URL verification errors require additional information on how to access the connected account’s website or to attest that the account is exempt from URL requirements. These types of issues require you or your connected account to provide supplemental information.

If you can’t resolve the issue, direct your connected account to contact Stripe Support.

Note
Stripe’s Terms of Service require all e-commerce businesses to populate their Account’s business_profile.url property with a working URL of their business website when activating the account with the card_payments capability. An account is considered an e-commerce business if it promotes or sells any products or services through an online website, social media profile, or mobile application. If the account doesn’t operate a website to promote their business, sell products, or accept payments, they’re required to provide the business_profile.product_description instead. A product description needs to detail the type of products being sold, as well as the manner in which the account charges its customers (for example, in-person transactions). For more information, see the Business website for account activation FAQ.

To help you recognize and handle the most common problems, the following table lists requirement error code values related to issues with the business URL and provides guidance for resolving them.

Error	Resolution
invalid_url_denylisted	The provided URL matches a generic business website that Stripe believes is unrelated to the account. To resolve the issue, provide a URL that is specific to the business.
invalid_url_format	The provided URL is in the incorrect format. To resolve the issue, provide a correctly formatted URL, such as https://example.com.
invalid_url_website_inaccessible	We can’t reach the website at the provided URL. If you block certain regions from viewing your website, temporarily remove the blocker until your website has been verified.
invalid_url_website_business_information_mismatch	Information on the website at the provided URL does not match the information on the Stripe account.
invalid_url_website_incomplete	The website at the provided URL is missing either a business name or a clear description of goods and services offered.
invalid_url_website_other	We are unable to verify the account’s business using a website, social media profile, or mobile application at the provided URL.
invalid_url_web_presence_detected	We have detected that the account uses a website, social media profile, or mobile application to sell or promote products or services, but a URL hasn’t been provided. To resolve the issue, provide a URL.
invalid_url_website_incomplete_customer_service_details	The website does not contain customer service details.
invalid_url_website_incomplete_return_policy	The website does not contain a return policy and process.
invalid_url_website_incomplete_refund_policy	The website does not contain a refund policy.
invalid_url_website_incomplete_cancellation_policy	The website does not contain a cancellation policy.
invalid_url_website_incomplete_legal_restrictions	The website does not contain applicable disclosures for products and services that are subject to legal or export restrictions.
invalid_url_website_incomplete_terms_and_conditions	The website does not contain terms and conditions.
invalid_url_website_incomplete_under_construction	We are unable to verify the website at the provided URL, because the website is still under construction.
invalid_url_website_inaccessible_password_protected	We are unable to verify the website at the provided URL, because the website is password-protected.
invalid_url_website_inaccessible_geoblocked	We are unable to verify the website at the provided URL, because certain regions are blocked from accessing it. If you block certain regions from viewing your website, temporarily remove the blocker until your website has been verified.
invalid_url_website_empty	We are unable to verify the website at the provided URL, because the website has no content.
Handle liveness requirements
An account can have one or more Persons with a proof_of_liveness requirement. A proof_of_liveness requirement might require collection of an electronic ID credential such as MyInfo in Singapore, or by using Stripe Identity to collect a document or selfie. We recommend using Stripe-hosted or embedded onboarding to satisfy all variations of the proof_of_liveness requirement.


Hosted

Embedded
Stripe-hosted onboarding can complete all variations of proof_of_liveness requirements.

Create an Account Link using the connected account ID, and send the account to the url returned.

Command Line
Select a language




curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \
  -u "sk_test_51RHFDr4MfXLuuMlFQCVJSaqW8RMW2tKT10VCO1ZJeCevKQzbKMRdlkocrX4VrwTwwv0w4uup5Sk3MJvw6RBkA5yQ00fAs1ucuE:" \

  --data-urlencode return_url="https://example.com/return" \
  -d type=account_onboarding \
  -d "collection_options[fields]"=currently_due
The account receives a prompt to complete the proof_of_liveness requirement, along with any other currently due requirements. Listen to the account.updated event sent to your webhook endpoint to be notified when the account completes requirements and updates their information. After the account completes the requirement, the account is redirected to the return_url specified.

Handle identity verification
In some cases, depending on how much of an account’s identity information Stripe has been able to verify, we might ask you to upload one or more documents. Required documents appear in the Account’s requirements hash.

The following entries in requirements.currently_due identify documents that you must upload:

person.verification.document: Requires a color scan or photo of an acceptable form of ID.
person.verification.additional_document: Requires a color scan or photo of a document verifying the user’s address, such as a utility bill.
company.verification.document: Requires a proof of entity document establishing the business’ entity ID number, such as the company’s articles of incorporation.
Uploading a document is a two-step process:

Upload the file to Stripe
Attach the file to the account
Note
For security reasons, Stripe doesn’t accept copies of IDs sent by email.

Upload a file
To upload a file, use the Create File API by using a POST to send the file data as part of a multipart/form-data request.

The uploaded file must meet these requirements:

Color image (8,000 pixels by 8,000 pixels or smaller)
10 MB or less
Identity documents are JPG or PNG format
Address or legal entity documents are JPG, PNG, or PDF format
Pass the file data in the file parameter and set the purpose parameter according to the Account or Person property that will hold the document. To identify the purpose, look up the property in the API Reference.

Command Line
Select a language



curl https://files.stripe.com/v1/files \

  -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
  -F "purpose"="identity_document" \
  -F "file"="@/path/to/a/file"
This request uploads the file and returns a token:




{
  "id": "{{FILE_ID}}",
  "created": 1403047735,
  "size": 4908
}
Use the token’s id value to attach the file to a connected account for identity verification.

Attach the file
After you upload the file and receive a representative token, update the Account or Person and provide the file ID in the appropriate parameter.

Below is an example for an ID document:

Command Line
Select a language




curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/persons/{{PERSON_ID}} \
  -u "sk_test_51RHFDr4MfXLuuMlFQCVJSaqW8RMW2tKT10VCO1ZJeCevKQzbKMRdlkocrX4VrwTwwv0w4uup5Sk3MJvw6RBkA5yQ00fAs1ucuE:" \

Below is an example for a company document:

Command Line
Select a language




curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \
  -u "sk_test_51RHFDr4MfXLuuMlFQCVJSaqW8RMW2tKT10VCO1ZJeCevKQzbKMRdlkocrX4VrwTwwv0w4uup5Sk3MJvw6RBkA5yQ00fAs1ucuE:" \
  -d "company[verification][document][front]"={{FILE_ID}}
This update changes verification.status to pending. If an additional person needs to be verified, use the Persons API to update them.

Confirm ID verification
Satisfying all identity verification requirements for a person or company triggers a v2.core.account_person.updated or v2.core.account[identity].updated webhook notification, signaling that the verification process is complete.

Stripe can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few business days to verify an image, depending on its readability.

If the verification attempt fails, the associated requirement entry contains an error with a code and description describing the cause. The description contains a human-readable message such as “The image supplied isn’t readable,” which is safe to present to your account user but isn’t localized. The code value is a string such as verification_document_not_readable, which you can use to localize error messages for your account users.

Verification failure also triggers a v2.core.account_person.updated or v2.core.account[identity].updated webhook notification.

Handle risk verifications
Stripe reports risk and compliance requirements in the accounts.requirements attribute. These requirements follow the schema: <id>.<requirement_description>.<resolution_path>:

id uniquely identifies information needed by Stripe or our financial partners. This identifier is always prefixed with interv_ to indicate that it is a risk verification requirement.
requirement_description specifically describes the information needed to complete the requirement, such as identity_verification, rejection_appeal, and so on.
resolution_path specifies how you or your connected account can provide the requested information:
challenge: Connected accounts must directly respond to challenge prompts. They often require sensitive information, such as a bank account, or information that only the account owner can provide, such as a selfie.
form: Connected accounts can complete form requests, or you can complete them on their behalf.
support: The requirement isn’t directly actionable. Contact Stripe Support.



{
  "id": "{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
  "object": "account",
  "requirements": {
      "current_deadline": 1234567800,
      "currently_due": [
          "{{REQUIREMENT_ID}}.restricted_or_prohibited_industry_diligence.form"
      ],
      "pending_verification": [],
      ...
  },
  ...
}
After satisfying a resolution path, the value of the requirement’s resolution path might change to support and the requirement also appears in the pending_verification section of the requirements hash. Stripe verifies the submitted information and either dismisses the requirement as resolved or posts a new currently due requirement.




{
  "id": "{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
  "object": "account",
  "requirements": {
      "current_deadline": 1234567800,
      "currently_due": [],
      "pending_verification": [
        "{{REQUIREMENT_ID}}.restricted_or_prohibited_industry_diligence.support"
      ],
      ...
  },
  ...
}
You can remediate risk and compliance requirements in any of the following ways, depending on the type of requirement:

Connect embedded components: You can embed Connect components directly into your website. When a requirement surfaces, direct your users to the account onboarding embedded component, where they’re prompted to complete outstanding requirements directly in your UI. Alternatively, use the Notification banner embedded component to prompt your users for any outstanding requirements.
Stripe hosted onboarding: You can generate links to direct your connected accounts to complete outstanding requirements programmatically through account links or manually in your platform Dashboard.
Complete on behalf of your accounts: You can use your platform Dashboard to identify and complete form-based risk requirements from connected account detail on behalf of your accounts.
The following table provides more detail about possible descriptions of risk- and compliance-related requirements.
