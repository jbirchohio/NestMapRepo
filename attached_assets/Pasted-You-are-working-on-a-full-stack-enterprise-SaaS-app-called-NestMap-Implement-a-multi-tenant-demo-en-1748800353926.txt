You are working on a full-stack enterprise SaaS app called NestMap. Implement a multi-tenant demo environment that demonstrates core white-label and organizational features for buyers and testers.

🎯 GOAL:
Create 2–3 demo organizations (tenants) with:
- Separate branded experiences (logo, colors, domains)
- Isolated trip data and users
- Pre-filled dummy data (users, trips, activities)

📦 TECH STACK CONTEXT:
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- Auth: Supabase with organization-scoped sessions
- ORM: Drizzle ORM with organization_id on all relevant tables
- Multi-tenancy: Already enforced via `organization_id` filtering

🛠️ WHAT TO DO:

1. 🌐 Seed Demo Orgs
   - Create 3 organizations in `organizations` table:
     - `demo-corp-1` ("Orbit Travel Co", blue theme)
     - `demo-corp-2` ("Haven Journeys", green theme)
     - `demo-corp-3` ("Velocity Trips", red theme)

2. 👥 Seed Demo Users
   - For each org, create at least:
     - 1 Admin user (e.g. `admin@orbit.com`, `admin@haven.com`)
     - 2 Agents or clients (role: `user`)
     - Store user passwords as `"password"` in development (but use PBKDF2 hashing)

3. 🧳 Seed Demo Trips & Activities
   - At least 2 trips per org, with activities, todos, notes, and budgets filled in
   - Ensure they link via `organization_id` and `user_id` properly

4. 🎨 Branding Config Per Org
   - Populate `branding` table or config:
     - Custom app name
     - Logo URL
     - Primary color
     - Domain (e.g. `demo1.nestmap.app`)

5. 🧪 Setup Demo Login Portal
   - Build `/demo` route on frontend to display clickable org cards:
     - On click → auto-login as demo admin (no password input)
     - Login should set proper `organization_id` in session

6. 🚫 Cleanup Logic (optional)
   - Add a dev-only endpoint `/api/dev/reset-demo` to reset data nightly or on button click

7. 🔐 Notes:
   - Ensure **RBAC**, **branding**, and **org isolation** are fully respected across demo users
   - Disable Stripe, email, and real bookings for demo users (mock data only)
