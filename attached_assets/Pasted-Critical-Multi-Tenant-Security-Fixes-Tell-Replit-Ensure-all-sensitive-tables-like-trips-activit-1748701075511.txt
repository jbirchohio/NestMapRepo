Critical Multi-Tenant Security Fixes

Tell Replit:

“Ensure all sensitive tables like trips, activities, analytics, messages, and notifications have a organization_id foreign key, and refactor all relevant queries to automatically scope by req.user.organization_id. Add middleware that injects organization context into every request automatically. Prevent cross-org data access.”

Why: Prevents users from accessing other orgs’ data — this is a dealbreaker for any B2B buyer.

⸻

🧪 Testing and CI

Tell Replit:

“Create a minimal automated test suite that covers authentication, trip creation, organization scoping, and PDF export. Add a basic CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to run linting and test coverage. Include test coverage for both admin and regular user roles.”

Why: No buyer wants to test manually. This adds trust.

⸻

🛠 Error Handling & Logging

Tell Replit:

“Replace duplicated try/catch blocks in route handlers with a global error-handling middleware. Ensure structured error logs are consistent and include user ID and organization ID where relevant. Surface errors via toast for users and logs for devs.”

Why: Centralizing error handling reduces bugs and makes the backend easier to maintain.

⸻

🏗 Refactor Redundant Logic

Tell Replit:

“Deduplicate trip cost calculations, conflict detection, OpenAI setup, and activity validation into shared services in lib/. Replace all repeated logic with imports from shared modules.”

Why: Bloat and repetition lower maintainability and buyer confidence.

⸻

⚙️ Config Management and Hardcoded Values

Tell Replit:

“Remove all hardcoded values for app name, port numbers, color themes, OAuth redirect URIs, and branding. Use process.env and fallback defaults. Store brand configs in a unified branding.config.ts file and expose them to the frontend.”

Why: White-label customers need to customize without editing source code.

⸻

🌐 White-Label Routing and Branding

Tell Replit:

“Fix domain-based routing to support multiple branded tenants. Ensure branding and organization data is injected based on subdomain. Expose organization-specific settings (logo, support contact, primary color) on load.”

Why: This is core to selling this as a white-label solution.

⸻

📈 Analytics Isolation

Tell Replit:

“Fix analytics endpoints to scope all queries by organization ID. Prevent admin access to analytics of other orgs. Add a check to ensure only org_admins can access analytics routes.”

Why: Analytics leaks are a huge red flag to enterprise buyers.

⸻

📄 Docs & DevOps

Tell Replit:

“Generate API docs using Swagger or Postman Collection. Add setup instructions for new tenants including white-label domain setup, Stripe onboarding, and SendGrid config. Write a CI config for automated builds and deploys to Railway or Docker.”

Why: These make onboarding and handoff easy — critical for buyers.
