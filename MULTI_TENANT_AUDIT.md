# NestMap Multi-Tenant Architecture Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit examines NestMap's white-labeled multi-organization logic, tenant isolation mechanisms, and organizational boundary enforcement. The analysis reveals a **partially implemented multi-tenant architecture** with significant gaps in organizational isolation that require immediate attention.

## 1. Organization Separation Analysis

### Database Schema Review
‚úÖ **Organization Structure Present**
- `organizations` table with proper structure (shared/schema.ts:24-44)
- `users.organization_id` foreign key for tenant association (shared/schema.ts:15)
- White-label configuration fields in organizations table

‚ùå **Critical Gap: Missing Organization Foreign Keys**
- `trips` table lacks `organization_id` field
- `activities` table lacks `organization_id` field  
- `todos` and `notes` tables lack organizational context
- Data isolation relies solely on user-level filtering

### Current Implementation Status
```sql
-- Users have organization context ‚úÖ
users.organization_id -> organizations.id

-- Trips are NOT organization-scoped ‚ùå
trips.userId -> users.id (no organization_id)

-- Activities inherit through trips ‚ùå  
activities.tripId -> trips.id (no direct organization context)
```

## 2. Authentication & Organization Context

### User Authentication Flow
‚úÖ **Working Components**
- Supabase auth integration with custom user table
- User creation with organization assignment capability
- Role-based permission system (server/rbac.ts)

‚ùå **Missing Middleware**
- No organization context middleware in requests
- No automatic organization filtering in database queries
- Domain-based organization routing exists but incomplete

### Organization Context Loading
```typescript
// Current: User lookup by auth_id ‚úÖ
app.get("/api/users/auth/:authId") 

// Missing: Organization context injection ‚ùå
// Should inject req.organization_id based on user.organization_id
```

## 3. Role & Permission Enforcement

### RBAC System Analysis
‚úÖ **System Permissions Work**
- Admin, Manager, User roles defined (server/rbac.ts:29-42)
- Permission checking functions implemented
- System-wide permission enforcement

‚ùå **Organization-Scoped Permissions Missing**
- Roles are global, not organization-specific
- No organization-level admin vs system admin distinction
- Cross-organization data access not prevented

### Permission Enforcement Gaps
```typescript
// Current: Global role check ‚úÖ
hasSystemPermission(user, 'MANAGE_USERS')

// Missing: Organization-scoped permissions ‚ùå
hasOrganizationPermission(user, orgId, 'MANAGE_USERS')
```

## 4. Analytics Separation

### Current Analytics Implementation
‚úÖ **User-Level Analytics Work**
- Personal analytics properly filtered by userId (server/analytics.ts:56-59)
- Data isolation within user scope

‚ùå **Organization Analytics Gaps**
```typescript
// Problem: Analytics endpoint requires manual user filtering
app.get("/api/analytics/corporate", async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.query.userId; // Manual user ID required
  // No automatic organization context
});
```

### Data Aggregation Issues
- Analytics queries filter by userId, not organization_id
- No organization-wide metrics aggregation
- Cross-organization data leakage possible through admin users

## 5. Database Behavior Audit

### Query Analysis - Critical Findings

‚ùå **No Organization Filtering in Core Queries**
```typescript
// trips endpoint - filters by userId only
app.get("/api/trips", async (req, res) => {
  const trips = await storage.getTripsByUserId(numericUserId);
  // Missing: WHERE organization_id = user.organization_id
});

// Activities - no organization context
app.get("/api/trips/:id/activities", async (req, res) => {
  const activities = await storage.getActivities(tripId);
  // Missing: organization boundary check
});
```

‚ùå **Admin Endpoints Lack Organization Scoping**
```typescript
// Global admin access - no organization boundaries
app.get("/api/admin/organizations", async (req, res) => {
  if (req.user.role !== 'admin') return res.status(403);
  const orgs = await db.select().from(organizations);
  // Returns ALL organizations regardless of user's org
});
```

## 6. Real-Time Logic Assessment

### WebSocket Implementation
‚ùå **Real-Time System Missing**
- No WebSocket implementation found
- No real-time updates between organization members
- No organization-scoped notification system

## 7. White-Label Domain Routing

### Domain-Based Organization Loading
‚úÖ **Partial Implementation**
```typescript
// Domain routing middleware exists (server/loadBalancer.ts:25-60)
app.get("/api/branding", async (req, res) => {
  const domain = req.headers.host;
  const orgByDomain = await db.select()
    .from(organizations)
    .where(eq(organizations.domain, domain));
});
```

‚ùå **Missing Organization Context Injection**
- Domain routing doesn't inject organization context into requests
- No middleware to automatically filter queries by domain-derived organization

## 8. Security Vulnerabilities

### Cross-Organization Data Access
üö® **HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES**

1. **Trip Access Vulnerability**
   - Users can access trips from other organizations if they know trip IDs
   - No organization boundary validation in trip endpoints

2. **Analytics Data Leakage**
   - Admin users can potentially access analytics from all organizations
   - No organization-scoped admin roles

3. **User Management Gaps**
   - Organization member endpoints don't validate organization boundaries
   - Potential for cross-organization user management

## 9. Test Results

### Manual API Testing
```bash
# Test 1: Analytics without proper auth
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/corporate"
# Response: {"message":"User ID is required"}
# ‚úÖ Properly requires authentication

# Test 2: Missing organization context tests
# ‚ùå Cannot test cross-organization isolation without proper org setup
```

## 10. Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Priority (Security Critical)

1. **Add Organization Foreign Keys**
```sql
ALTER TABLE trips ADD COLUMN organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id);
ALTER TABLE activities ADD COLUMN organization_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE todos ADD COLUMN organization_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE notes ADD COLUMN organization_id INTEGER;
```

2. **Create Organization Context Middleware**
```typescript
export function organizationMiddleware(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  const user = req.user;
  if (user?.organization_id) {
    req.organizationId = user.organization_id;
  }
  next();
}
```

3. **Add Organization Filtering to All Queries**
```typescript
// Example: Trips should filter by organization
const trips = await db.select()
  .from(trips)
  .where(and(
    eq(trips.userId, userId),
    eq(trips.organization_id, req.organizationId)
  ));
```

### Medium Priority

1. **Organization-Scoped RBAC**
2. **Real-time notification system with org boundaries**
3. **Enhanced white-label domain routing**

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Multi-tenant database schema optimization**
2. **Organization-aware analytics aggregation**
3. **Comprehensive audit logging per organization**

## 11. Compliance Status

### SOC2 Compliance Gaps
- ‚ùå Data isolation not properly implemented
- ‚ùå Access controls missing organization boundaries
- ‚ùå Audit trails don't capture organization context

### Recommended Actions
1. Implement proper tenant isolation before production deployment
2. Add comprehensive organization boundary testing
3. Update security documentation to reflect multi-tenant architecture

## Conclusion

NestMap has the foundational structure for multi-tenancy but **lacks critical implementation** of organizational boundaries. The current system has significant security vulnerabilities that could allow cross-organization data access. Immediate implementation of organization foreign keys and query filtering is required before the system can be considered production-ready for multi-tenant use.

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Cross-organization data access possible
**Recommended Action: Immediate remediation required**
