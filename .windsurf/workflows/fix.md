description: Fixing front end errors
---

You are auditing TypeScript errors for a B2B SaaS travel planning app using ES modules, JWT multitenant isolation, and strict camelCase frontend vs snake_case backend naming.

Every file in the client/src directory may have a corresponding .ts-check-logs file in client/ts-check-logs/ which lists all known TypeScript errors and warnings.

Your job:

Load the relevant ts-check-logs/<relative-file>.log file for the frontend file you're reviewing (e.g., BookingWorkflow.tsx → ts-check-logs/components/booking/BookingWorkflow.tsx.log).

Use the log to find and prioritize the exact lines and error types.

Fix only the root-cause issue — if the error originated from a backend API, crawl backend server/routes, server/services, and server/types to fix it there first.

Once all errors and warnings listed in that log file are fully resolved in the code, mark the log as ✅ COMPLETE at the top of the file and append the file name. 

If this is your "first time" looking at the folder - skip any of the log files marked as complete.
