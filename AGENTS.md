## Architectural Issues & Recommendations

### Identified Issues

1. **Redundant Files**:
   - `server/routes/analytics-broken.ts` - Not referenced anywhere in the codebase
   - `server/routes/bookings-broken.ts` - Not referenced anywhere in the codebase
   - `tests/test-ai-location.js` and `tests/test-ai-location.mjs` - Duplicate files

2. **Domain Management Inconsistency**:
   - `domains.ts` and `customDomains.ts` have overlapping functionality
   - `customDomains.ts` is currently active but `domains.ts` has more comprehensive features

3. **Schema Migration Issues**:
   - Several tables in `shared/schema.ts` need to be migrated to `server/db/schema.ts`
   - Inconsistent use of UUID vs. serial IDs across tables

4. **Unused Functions**:
   - `prepareV2Routes` in `server/routes/v1/index.ts`
   - `setupLegacyRedirects` in `server/routes/v1/index.ts`

### Recommendations

1. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Remove identified dead code and unused files
   - Consolidate domain management functionality into a single module
   - Standardize on ESM modules for test files

2. **Schema Standardization**:
   - Complete migration of remaining tables to `server/db/schema.ts`
   - Standardize on UUID for all ID fields
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions (camelCase in frontend, snake_case in DB)

3. **API Consistency**:
   - Implement consistent error handling across all endpoints
   - Standardize response formats for all API endpoints
   - Add comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
   - Add pagination for large data sets

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
   - Add comprehensive input sanitization
   - Enhance JWT security with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms
