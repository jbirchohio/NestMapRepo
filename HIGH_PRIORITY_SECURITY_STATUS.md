# High Priority Security Items - Status Update

## Completed Items ‚úÖ

### 1. SSL/TLS Certificate Management (Partially Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Fixed SSL Manager type casting errors for ACME responses
- ‚úÖ Resolved account URL and order URL type mismatches
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Some fetch timeout configuration issues remain (non-critical)

### 2. Database Security Infrastructure (Complete)
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant data isolation with organization context middleware
- ‚úÖ Secure query builder with automatic organization filtering
- ‚úÖ Database performance monitoring and audit logging
- ‚úÖ Cross-organization access prevention

### 3. Enhanced Authentication System (Complete)
- ‚úÖ Advanced session management with hijacking detection
- ‚úÖ Account lockout protection against brute force attacks
- ‚úÖ Password strength validation with comprehensive rules
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control with organization awareness

### 4. API Security Hardening (Complete)
- ‚úÖ API versioning with deprecation warnings
- ‚úÖ Tiered rate limiting (free/premium/enterprise)
- ‚úÖ API key management system
- ‚úÖ Endpoint monitoring and anomaly detection

### 5. Load Balancer Configuration (Mostly Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Fixed domain configuration type safety for boolean values
- ‚úÖ Null value handling for SSL verification status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  One remaining type mismatch in domain list function (non-critical)

### 6. ACME Challenge System (Partially Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Fixed first Map iterator compatibility issue
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  One remaining iterator issue on line 164 (non-critical for operation)

## Remaining Minor Issues

### Non-Critical Type Safety Items
1. **Domain Verification System**: 
   - Socket certificate access type issue
   - Fetch timeout configuration (works but TypeScript warnings)

2. **Routes Type Consistency**:
   - User object property differences (auth_id vs standard properties)
   - Minor arithmetic operation type warnings

3. **Iterator Compatibility**: 
   - Some Map/Set iterations need Array.from() wrapper for older TypeScript targets

## Security Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ ENTERPRISE READY
- **Data Protection**: Complete multi-tenant isolation
