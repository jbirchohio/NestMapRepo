## ðŸš€ B2B Feature Integration Plan

The following pages were identified as unused but represent important B2B functionality:

- `Analytics.tsx` â€“ business intelligence dashboard for organizations
- `Approvals.tsx` â€“ manage travel approvals and corporate policies
- `InvoiceCenter.tsx` â€“ central location for proposal invoicing

### Tasks
1. **Route Integration** â€“ expose the above pages at `/analytics`, `/approvals`, and `/invoice-center` in `client/src/config/routes.ts`.
2. **Navigation Links** â€“ add corresponding navigation items in `MainNavigation` so corporate users can access them.
3. **Superadmin Cleanup** â€“ keep `SuperadminClean.tsx` as the active superadmin portal and do not reintroduce outdated versions.
4. **Testing** â€“ verify the new routes render properly and navigation works when logged in.
