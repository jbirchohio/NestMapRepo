# NestMap Audit Plan

## âœ… Verified Working
- [ ] AI Itinerary generation (budget, preferences, dates)
- [ ] Proposal Center (PDF generation, branded templates, cost analysis)
- [ ] Stripe billing (Team and Enterprise plans)
- [ ] Multi-tenant orgs + role management (admin/member/viewer)
- [ ] Proposal-to-invoice flow (quote, approve, Stripe invoice)
- [ ] Export tools (PDF, CSV, Google Calendar sync)
- [ ] White-labeling support (custom domains, branding per org)
- [ ] Superadmin portal (org/user access, system settings)
- [ ] Mobile UI handling (Capacitor layout and interactions)

## ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied
<!-- Add fixes as they're implemented -->
- Removed unused CalendarDays import in `FlightSearch`.
- Fixed role check in `Dashboard` to use `user.role`.
- Marked legacy `SuperadminFixed` and `SuperadminSimple` pages as unused.
- Added root node type path in `client/tsconfig.json` for tsc.
- Fixed auth logger to use `payload.email` and marked unused rate limiter in `jwtAuth`.
- Flagged raw SQL queries in `superadmin` routes for parameterization.

## ðŸ”® Suggested Enhancements
- [ ] Add sample orgs and proposals for demo [optional]
- [ ] Implement proposal analytics (opens/views) [optional]

## ðŸš€ B2B Feature Integration Plan

The following pages were identified as unused but represent important B2B functionality:

- `Analytics.tsx` â€“ business intelligence dashboard for organizations
- `Approvals.tsx` â€“ manage travel approvals and corporate policies
- `InvoiceCenter.tsx` â€“ central location for proposal invoicing

### Tasks
1. **Route Integration** â€“ expose the above pages at `/analytics`, `/approvals`, and `/invoice-center` in `client/src/config/routes.ts`.
2. **Navigation Links** â€“ add corresponding navigation items in `MainNavigation` so corporate users can access them.
3. **Superadmin Cleanup** â€“ keep `SuperadminClean.tsx` as the active superadmin portal and do not reintroduce outdated versions.
4. **Testing** â€“ verify the new routes render properly and navigation works when logged in.
