# TypeScript Error Resolution Plan

## Current Status
- Identified over 4,000 TypeScript errors across the codebase
- Memory constraints require batching fixes in smaller chunks
- Initial analysis of key components completed

## Error Categories
1. **Module Resolution**
   - Missing type declarations for third-party libraries
   - Incorrect path aliases in imports
   - Missing or incorrect type definitions

2. **Type Safety**
   - Implicit 'any' types
   - Missing type annotations
   - Inconsistent type usage across components

3. **Component Props**
   - Mismatched prop types between parent and child components
   - Missing required props
   - Incorrect event handler types

## Next Steps

### 1. Module Resolution Fixes
- [ ] Create/update `global.d.ts` for missing type declarations
- [ ] Verify and align path aliases in `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts`
- [ ] Install missing `@types/*` packages

### 2. Type Safety Improvements
- [ ] Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- [ ] Add explicit return types to functions
- [ ] Fix implicit 'any' types
- [ ] Standardize API response types

### 3. Component Type Fixes
- [ ] Review and update prop types for all components
- [ ] Ensure consistent type usage between parent and child components
- [ ] Fix event handler types

## Current Progress

### Files Reviewed
- `client/src/components/ui/use-toast.ts`
- `client/src/components/navigation/MainNavigation.tsx`
- `client/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`
- `client/src/contexts/auth/AuthContext.tsx`

### Identified Issues
1. **use-toast.ts**
   - Missing type definitions for toast variants
   - Incomplete type definitions for toast actions

2. **MainNavigation.tsx**
   - Prop type mismatches with child components
   - Inconsistent user type usage

3. **useNotifications.ts**
   - Missing error handling types
   - Inconsistent notification type usage

4. **AuthContext.tsx**
   - Complex type definitions that could be simplified
   - Missing type guards for authentication state

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration (1-2 days)
- [ ] Set up TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Configure path aliases
- [ ] Install missing type definitions

### Phase 2: Core Type Fixes (3-5 days)
- [ ] Fix module resolution issues
- [ ] Standardize API types
- [ ] Update component prop types

### Phase 3: Advanced Type Safety (2-3 days)
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add type guards
- [ ] Improve type inference

## Notes
- All changes should be made in small, reviewable commits
- Each commit should focus on a single type of fix
- Document any breaking changes in the commit message

## ðŸš€ Feature Enhancement Roadmap

The following initiatives build on the existing platform to deliver smarter planning and better integrations.

### Broaden AI Capabilities
- [ ] Build ML models for price forecasting and budget optimization using booking history.
- [ ] Add real-time disruption monitoring to reroute trips when flights or destinations are impacted.
- [x] Support group-travel planning by merging traveler preferences into a consensus itinerary.

### Expand Integrations
- [ ] Integrate additional booking providers and GDS systems for broader inventory.
- [ ] Offer carbon offset purchasing and loyalty program support for enterprise clients.

### Machine Learning & Data Insights
- [ ] Train personalized recommendation models and spend forecasting from trip data.
- [ ] Provide an analytics dashboard with AI-driven insights for organizations.

### Performance & Architecture
- [ ] Implement caching and optimize database indexes.
- [ ] Introduce a service layer with optional dependency injection for cleaner APIs.

### Mobile & Collaboration
- [ ] Enable offline mode and push notifications in the mobile apps.
- [ ] Add real-time itinerary editing and in-app messaging for teams.

## TypeScript Type System Refactoring

### Completed Work
- Updated `Notification` type to include all necessary fields for the notification system
- Ensured type safety across all notification-related components
- Reviewed and updated prop types for navigation components
- Fixed type issues in the `useNotifications` hook
- Ensured proper typing for user authentication and session management

### Files Updated
- `client/src/types/notification.ts`
- `client/src/components/navigation/types.ts`
- `client/src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`
- `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- `client/src/types/user.ts`

### Components Reviewed
- `MainNavigation` - Updated to use proper types for props and state
- `DesktopNavigation` - Ensured type safety for navigation items and user data
- `MobileMenu` - Updated to use consistent types with desktop navigation
- `NotificationsMenu` - Fixed type issues with notification data
- `UserMenu` - Ensured proper typing for user data and menu items
- `NavigationLink` - Updated to use proper prop types

### Hooks Reviewed
- `useNotifications` - Ensured proper typing for notification state and actions
- `useAuth` - Updated to use proper types for authentication state and actions

### Next Steps
1. Review and fix any remaining TypeScript errors in the codebase
2. Add unit tests for the notification and navigation components
3. Implement error boundaries for better error handling
4. Add loading states for async operations
5. Consider adding end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Known Issues
- Some components may still have implicit `any` types that need to be addressed
- Need to add proper error handling for API calls in the notification system
- Consider adding TypeScript strict mode to catch additional type issues

## Performance Considerations
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations in the notification system
- Consider virtualizing the notification list for better performance with large datasets
- Optimize re-renders in the navigation components
