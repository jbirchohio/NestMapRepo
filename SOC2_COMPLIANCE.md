# SOC 2 Compliance Framework

## Security Controls Implementation

### âœ… **Access Controls (CC6.1)**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** - OAuth 2.0 with Google/Microsoft integration
- **Role-Based Access Control** - 5-tier permission system (Guest, User, Manager, Admin, Super Admin)
- **Session Management** - Secure session handling with automatic timeouts
- **Organization-Level Isolation** - Multi-tenant data segregation

### âœ… **System Operations (CC7.1)**
- **Environment Separation** - Development, staging, and production environments
- **Configuration Management** - Environment-based secrets and configuration
- **Monitoring & Logging** - Comprehensive application and access logging
- **Backup Procedures** - Automated database backups with point-in-time recovery

### âœ… **Change Management (CC8.1)**
- **Version Control** - Git-based source code management
- **Code Review Process** - Pull request workflow with approval requirements
- **Deployment Controls** - Containerized deployments with rollback capabilities
- **Documentation Standards** - Comprehensive technical and operational documentation

### âœ… **Data Protection (CC6.7)**
- **Encryption in Transit** - HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Encryption at Rest** - Database-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Data Classification** - Customer data, PII, and business data categorization
- **Data Retention Policies** - Automated data lifecycle management

### âœ… **Availability (A1.1)**
- **Redundancy** - Multi-region deployment capabilities
- **Load Balancing** - Horizontal scaling with traffic distribution
- **Health Monitoring** - Application and database health checks
- **Disaster Recovery** - Automated failover and recovery procedures

### âœ… **Processing Integrity (PI1.1)**
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive data validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling** - Graceful error handling with logging
- **Data Integrity Checks** - Database constraints and validation rules
- **Audit Trails** - Complete user action and data change logging

### âœ… **Confidentiality (C1.1)**
- **Data Minimization** - Collection of only necessary data
- **Access Logging** - All data access is logged and monitored
- **Data Masking** - Sensitive data protection in non-production environments
- **Third-Party Security** - Vendor security assessments and agreements
