## Error Types:

### Collection Processing
Errors related to processing collections of travel data (flights, hotels, activities).

### Sorting Algorithms
Type mismatches in implementing sorting algorithms for travel options by price, duration, or relevance.

### Filtering Implementation
Problems with implementing filters for travel search results based on user preferences.

This utility provides array helper functions for the B2B travel planning SaaS application. The errors indicate issues with how collections of travel data are processed from external APIs like Duffel, how sorting algorithms are implemented to present travel options in a meaningful order, and how filtering is implemented to help users narrow down travel choices based on their preferences and requirements.
