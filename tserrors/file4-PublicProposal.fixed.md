## Error Types:

### Type Mismatches
Likely issues with proposal data types not matching expected interfaces.

### API Integration Issues
Errors related to integration with external travel APIs (potentially Google Maps, Duffel).

This component is responsible for displaying travel proposals to clients in a public-facing interface. The errors suggest issues with how travel itinerary data is typed and handled when shared publicly.
