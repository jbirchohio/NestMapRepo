# ReplyTune Development Progress

## Day 6: Placeholder/Mock Data Removal

- **Stripe Checkout URL:** Implemented a Supabase Edge Function (`create-checkout-session`) to generate a Stripe Checkout session URL and updated `UsageBar.tsx` to use it.
- **Usage Update:** Modified the `generate-reply` Edge Function to return the updated usage count and updated `Sidebar.tsx` to reflect this.

- **Testing Framework:** Set up `vitest` and `react-testing-library` for unit and component testing.
- **Basic Test:** Wrote a basic test for the `Sidebar` component to ensure it renders correctly.
- **Authentication Tests:** Implemented tests for the authentication flow in `Sidebar.tsx`, including sign-in and sign-out.
- **Reply Generation Tests:** Added tests for GPT reply generation and usage limit enforcement.
- **Tone Training Tests:** Implemented tests for adding and deleting tone samples in the `ToneTrainer` component.
- **Usage Bar Tests:** Added tests for displaying usage information and the upgrade button in the `UsageBar` component.
- **Build Fixes:** Corrected module resolution and TypeScript configuration errors.

- **OpenAI Integration:** Replaced the placeholder OpenAI call with a real API call in the `generate-reply` Edge Function.
- **Usage Enforcement:** Implemented usage limit enforcement in the `generate-reply` Edge Function based on user tier.

- **Reply Editor:** Made the reply editor editable and added a button to insert the generated reply into the Gmail compose window.

- **Content Script:** Updated the content script to inject the React application into the Gmail UI.
- **DOM Injection:** Implemented a `MutationObserver` to reliably inject the app's root element into the Gmail sidebar when an email is opened.
- **Email Data Extraction:** Implemented logic in `content.tsx` to extract the subject, sender, and body of the opened email, passing this data to the `Sidebar` component.

- **Authentication:** Implemented Google OAuth with Supabase in `Sidebar.tsx`.
- **Edge Function:** Implemented the core logic for the `generate-reply` Supabase Edge Function, including user validation, tone sample fetching, and usage logging.
- **Frontend Integration:** Connected the frontend to the `generate-reply` edge function. The `Sidebar` now calls the function, and the response is displayed in the `ReplyEditor`. Usage data is passed to the `UsageBar`.
- **Tone Training:** Implemented the `ToneTrainer` component, allowing pro users to add and delete tone samples.
- **Billing:** Added a Stripe Checkout button to the `UsageBar` to allow users to upgrade to the Pro plan.
- **Stripe Webhook:** Created a Supabase Edge Function to handle the Stripe webhook and update user tiers.
- **Chrome Extension:** Created the `manifest.json` and a basic content script.
- **Build:** Successfully built the production version of the application.

- **Project Setup:** Initialized a new React + TypeScript project using Vite (`replytune-extension`).
- **Dependencies:** Installed `npm` dependencies, including `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- **Database Schema:** Created `schema.sql` with tables for `users`, `tone_samples`, and `usage_logs` as per the PRD.
- **Component Scaffolding:** Created placeholder files for UI components: `Sidebar.tsx`, `ReplyEditor.tsx`, `ToneTrainer.tsx`, and `UsageBar.tsx`.
- **Supabase Client:** Set up the Supabase client (`supabaseClient.ts`) and configured environment variables (`.env`). Added `.env` to `.gitignore`.
- **App Structure:** Updated `App.tsx` to render the newly created components.
