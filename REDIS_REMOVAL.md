# Redis Removal for Simplified Deployment

## Overview
Redis has been completely removed from the NestMap application to simplify deployment and reduce infrastructure requirements for potential buyers.

## What Was Removed
- **Redis dependencies**: `ioredis` and `@types/ioredis` packages
- **Redis client files**: `server/src/db/redis.ts` and `server/utils/redis.ts`
- **Redis-dependent features**:
  - Refresh token storage and revocation
  - Token blacklisting
  - Session caching

## Impact on Functionality
The application now uses **stateless JWT tokens** instead of Redis-backed token management:

### ✅ Still Works
- User authentication and authorization
- Access token generation and verification
- Password reset tokens
- All core application features

### ⚠️ Simplified Behavior
- **Refresh tokens**: No longer stored server-side (stateless)
- **Token revocation**: Not implemented (tokens remain valid until expiry)
- **Session management**: Relies on JWT expiration times

## For Production Deployment
If you need token revocation capabilities in production, you can:

1. **Database-based approach**: Store refresh tokens in PostgreSQL
2. **Re-add Redis**: Restore Redis for caching and token management
3. **Token blacklist**: Implement a simple database table for revoked tokens

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Simpler deployment**: No Redis server required
- **Lower infrastructure costs**: One less service to manage
- **Easier scaling**: Stateless authentication scales horizontally
- **Reduced complexity**: Fewer moving parts for buyers to understand

## Security Considerations
- Use shorter token expiration times (current: 15m access, 7d refresh)
- Implement logout on the client side by clearing tokens
- Consider implementing a token blacklist in the database if needed

This simplified architecture makes the application easier to deploy and maintain while preserving all core functionality.
