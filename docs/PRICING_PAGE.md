## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?
Yes, you can change your plan at any time. If you upgrade, you'll be charged the prorated difference. If you downgrade, you'll receive credit toward your next billing cycle.

### Do you offer a free trial?
Yes! Both our Premium and Professional plans come with a 14-day free trial. No credit card required to start.

### What happens to my trips if I downgrade?
Your trips will remain saved, but premium features will be disabled. You'll need to reduce your trips to 3 if downgrading to Free.

### Do you offer refunds?
We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on annual plans. Monthly plans can be canceled at any time but are not eligible for partial refunds.

### Is there a discount for non-profits or educational institutions?
Yes, we offer a 25% discount for qualified non-profit organizations and educational institutions. Contact our sales team for details.

### How does the collaborative planning work?
You can invite others to view and edit your trips (with permission controls). They'll need to create a NestMap account, but won't need a paid plan to collaborate on your trips.
