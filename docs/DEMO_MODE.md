## Setting Up Demo Mode

### For Administrators

1. **Enable Demo Mode**:
```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_DEMO_MODE=true
DEMO_RESET_INTERVAL=30  # minutes
```

2. **Seed Demo Data**:
```bash
npm run seed:demo
```

3. **Start Auto-Reset Scheduler** (optional):
```javascript
// In server startup
import { startDemoResetScheduler } from './services/demoResetService';
if (process.env.ENABLE_DEMO_MODE === 'true') {
  startDemoResetScheduler();
}
```

### API Testing with Demo Mode

For developers and integrators, you can test the API using demo headers:

```bash
# Get demo status
curl https://your-domain.com/api/demo/status

# Make API calls as demo user
curl -H "X-Demo-Mode: true" \
     -H "X-Demo-User-Id: demo-sarah-chen" \
     https://your-domain.com/api/trips

# Quick login for testing
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/demo/quick-login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"role": "admin"}'
```

### Issue: "Cannot perform this action in demo mode"
**Solution**: Some operations are restricted in demo mode for security. This includes real bookings, emails, and payment processing.
