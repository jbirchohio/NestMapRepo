# Comprehensive API Rate Limiting Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive API rate limiting across all NestMap endpoints to address the critical security requirement "No comprehensive API rate limiting implementation".

## Security Features Implemented

### Multi-Layered Rate Limiting Architecture

1. **Global API Rate Limiting**
   - Applied to all `/api/*` endpoints
   - 1000 requests per hour per IP
   - 50 request burst limit per minute
   - Progressive blocking for violations

2. **Authentication-Specific Rate Limiting**
   - Applied to `/api/auth/*` endpoints
   - 20 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - 5 request burst limit per minute
   - Enhanced logging for suspicious activity

3. **Organization-Tier Based Rate Limiting**
   - Free tier: 100 requests/hour, 20 burst
   - Team tier: 1000 requests/hour, 100 burst
   - Enterprise tier: 10000 requests/hour, 500 burst
   - Automatic tier detection from user context

4. **Endpoint-Specific Rate Limiting**
   - Analytics endpoints: 50 requests/hour, 10 burst
   - Export endpoints: 10 requests/hour, 3 burst
   - Search endpoints: 200 requests/hour, 30 burst

## Protected Endpoints

### Analytics Endpoints (Limited to 50/hour)
- `/api/analytics` - Main analytics dashboard data
- `/api/analytics/corporate` - Corporate analytics
- `/api/analytics/agency` - Agency analytics

### Export Endpoints (Limited to 10/hour)
- `/api/analytics/export` - CSV analytics export

### Authentication Endpoints (Limited to 20/15min)
- All `/api/auth/*` routes

## Rate Limiting Features

### Advanced Protection Mechanisms
- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: Precise rate control with burst handling
- **Progressive Blocking**: Temporary blocks for repeated violations
- **IP Blocking**: Global 24-hour blocks for severe abuse
- **Violation Recovery**: Gradual reduction of violation counts
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive violation tracking

### HTTP Headers
All rate-limited responses include standard headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Request limit for the time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when limit resets
- `X-RateLimit-Tier`: User's organization tier (when applicable)
- `X-RateLimit-Endpoint`: Specific endpoint type (when applicable)
- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before retry (on 429 responses)

### Violation Handling
- **5 violations**: 10-minute temporary block
- **10 violations**: 1-hour temporary block
- **20 violations**: 24-hour global IP block
- **Delay Escalation**: Progressive delays for repeated violations

## Rate Limiting Configuration

### Tiered Limits by Organization
```javascript
'free': { requests: 100, windowMs: 3600000, burstLimit: 20 }
'team': { requests: 1000, windowMs: 3600000, burstLimit: 100 }
'enterprise': { requests: 10000, windowMs: 3600000, burstLimit: 500 }
```

### Endpoint-Specific Limits
```javascript
'analytics': { requests: 50, windowMs: 3600000, burstLimit: 10 }
'export': { requests: 10, windowMs: 3600000, burstLimit: 3 }
'auth': { requests: 20, windowMs: 900000, burstLimit: 5 }
```

## Security Benefits

### Attack Prevention
- **DDoS Protection**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Brute Force Mitigation**: Limits authentication attempts
- **Data Harvesting Prevention**: Protects against bulk data extraction
- **API Abuse Prevention**: Stops automated abuse patterns

### Resource Protection
- **Database Load Control**: Prevents expensive query overload
- **Export Rate Control**: Limits resource-intensive operations
- **Analytics Protection**: Prevents excessive reporting queries
- **Burst Protection**: Handles traffic spikes gracefully

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Violation Logging
All rate limit violations are logged with:
- IP address and user context
- Endpoint and violation count
- Timestamp and blocking status
- User agent and request details

### Performance Monitoring
- Request tracking per endpoint
- Response time monitoring
- Error rate alerting
- Slow query detection

## Integration Status

### Middleware Chain Order
1. Global API rate limiting (first layer)
2. Authentication rate limiting (auth endpoints)
3. Organization tier limiting (user context)
4. Endpoint-specific limiting (sensitive endpoints)
5. Standard API security middleware

### Applied Routes
- ✅ `/api/analytics` - Analytics rate limiting
- ✅ `/api/analytics/corporate` - Analytics rate limiting
- ✅ `/api/analytics/agency` - Analytics rate limiting
- ✅ `/api/analytics/export` - Export rate limiting
- ✅ `/api/auth/*` - Authentication rate limiting
- ✅ All other `/api/*` - Global rate limiting

## Error Responses

### 429 Too Many Requests
```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests. Please try again later.",
  "retryAfter": 3600,
  "tier": "free"
}
```

### Endpoint-Specific Errors
```json
{
  "error": "analytics rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "This endpoint has specific rate limits. Please try again later.",
  "endpoint": "analytics",
  "retryAfter": 3600
}
```
