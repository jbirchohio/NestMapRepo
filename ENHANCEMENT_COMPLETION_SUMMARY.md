- Added network error detection and user-friendly messaging
- Implemented proper error propagation and logging
- Created structured error handling utilities

**Error Handling Improvements**:
```typescript
// Network error handling
if (error instanceof TypeError && error.message.includes('fetch')) {
  throw new Error('Network connection failed. Please check your internet connection.');
}

// Comprehensive error boundary coverage
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Router />
</ErrorBoundary>
```
